`extras` provides helper functions for Bayesian analyses.

In particular it provides functions to summarise vectors of MCMC (Monte
Carlo Markov Chain) samples, draw random samples from various
distributions and calculate deviance residuals as well as R translations
of some BUGS (Bayesian Using Gibbs Sampling), JAGS (Just Another Gibbs
Sampler), STAN and TMB (Template Model Builder) functions.

## Installation

<!-- To install the latest release from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) -->

To install the developmental version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/extras)

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("poissonconsulting/extras")
```

## Demonstration

### Summarise MCMC Samples

The `extras` package provides functions to summarise MCMC samples like
`svalue()` which gives the *surprisal value* (Greenland, 2019)

``` r
library(extras)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'extras'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     step

set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100)
svalue(rnorm(100))
#> [1] 0.3183615
svalue(rnorm(100, mean = 1))
#> [1] 1.704015
svalue(rnorm(100, mean = 2))
#> [1] 3.850857
svalue(rnorm(100, mean = 3))
#> [1] 5.073249
```

### Distributions

Implemented distributions with functions to draw random samples,
calculate log-likelihoods, and calculate deviance residuals for include:

- Bernoulli
- Beta-binomial
- Gamma
- Gamma-Poisson
- Zero-inflated gamma-Poisson
- Log-Normal
- Negative Binomial
- Normal
- Poisson
- Zero-inflated Poisson
- Skew Normal
- Student’s t

### R translations

The package also provides R translations of `BUGS` (and `JAGS`)
functions such as `pow()` and `log<-`.

``` r
pow(10, 2)
#> [1] 100

mu <- NULL
log(mu) <- 1
mu
#> [1] 2.718282
```

### Numericise R Objects

Atomic vectors, matrices, arrays and data.frames of appropriate classes
can be converted to numeric objects suitable for Bayesian analysis using
the `numericise()` (and `numericize()`) function.

``` r
numericise(
  data.frame(
    logical = c(TRUE, FALSE),
    factor = factor(c("blue", "green")),
    Date = as.Date(c("2000-01-01", "2000-01-02")),
    hms = hms::as_hms(c("00:00:02", "00:01:01"))
  )
)
#>      logical factor  Date hms
#> [1,]       1      1 10957   2
#> [2,]       0      2 10958  61
```
