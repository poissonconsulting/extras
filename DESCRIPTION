Description: Functions to 'numericise' 'R' objects (coerce to numeric
    objects), summarise 'MCMC' (Monte Carlo Markov Chain) samples and
    calculate deviance residuals as well as 'R' translations of 'BUGS'
    (Bayesian Using Gibbs Sampling) and 'JAGS' (Just Another Gibbs
    Sampler) functions.
